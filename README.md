#Quick view to my exercices
##What's this all about?
As the title says this is a collection of "proyects" in JavaScript that I am still doing...<br>
I say proyects in quotes because i did some in 1 day and its basically a js.file that prints strings and numbers in the console, nothing fancy, but you need to start with something right?.This basics exercices are teaching me the js syntax in basics concepts like:

- Functions (In the espression and declaration way)

- Loops,arrays ( Here the string work like arrays, crazy right?)

- Objects(Right now i am a little loosed with the passing by refernce thing)

- And a big etc.

- Even right now i am using this text to learn to write documentation and use markdown
